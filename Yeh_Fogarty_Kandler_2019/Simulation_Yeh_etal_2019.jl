1. Initiate population with random variants at all traits and no links
2. Initiate array, or list of matrices for links (0 1 storage)
3. Iterate through timesteps
    * individuals simultanously chose interaction partner 
    * randomly pick a trait to copy from this partner 
    * if trait is linked the focal individuals copies links with propability 1 - b
    * copying successful with propability c (unsuccessful = id keeps own variant)
    * after transmission new links form at rate of association a (between any unlinked traits)
    * each trait can be innovated with probability Î¼ (switch to another variant)
4. Burn in period of 5000 timesteps with unbiased transmission
5. additional 2000 timesteps with:
    * unbiased transmission
    * pay- off biased transmission
    * conformity-biased (only one trait modeled no burn in needed)
        
record variant frequencies at each timestep

## 1. Initiate population

## individuals 
n = 10
## number of traits
traits = 5
## variants
variants = [1, 2, 3, 4]

## store information in matrix
pop = zeros(Int64, n, traits)
## randomly asign variants to traits for n individuals
for i in 1:n 

    pop[i,:] = rand(variants, 5)
        
end

## 2. Initiate array for links

links_array = zeros(Int64, traits, traits, n) ## rows and columns are traits, 3rd dimension are individuals

## 3. Iterate through timesteps
timesteps = 100

for i in 1:timesteps
